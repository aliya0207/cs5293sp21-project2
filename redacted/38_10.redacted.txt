One of the very best Three Stooges shorts ever. A spooky house full of evil guys and "The Goon" challenge the ██████████████████████'s best men. █████ is in top form in the famous in-the-dark scene. ████ Sitka provides excellent support in his ████████████ role, as the target of a murder plot. Before it's over, Shemp's "trusty little shovel" is employed to great effect. This 16 minute gem moves about as fast as any Stooge's short and packs twice the wallop. Highly recommended.
